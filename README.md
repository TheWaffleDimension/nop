# NOP
NOP is a game similar to Roblox, however it is centered around military operations.

# Engine
The engine is completely custom built using C++ and OpenGL, and features a custom level editor.

# Powerful Scripting
The engine uses the Lua scripting language, with custom API calls added on to give more functionality and improve the experience of users.

# Multiplayer
Multiplayer will be supported, and will contain hash checking to ensure that clients have not been modified.
Multiplayer servers will have to be hosted yourself, however. I don't have the storage space nor the bandwidth to host every game.
